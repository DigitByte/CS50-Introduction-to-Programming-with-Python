## Lecture 1 – Conditionals

### Scope
- Scope is the context in which a variable exists and can be accessed.
- Variables may not be accessible outside the scope in which they are created.

### Comparison Operators
Python provides several built-in comparison operators:
- `>` – Greater than  
- `>=` – Greater than or equal to  
- `<` – Less than  
- `<=` – Less than or equal to  
- `==` – Equal to (comparison)  
- `!=` – Not equal to  

### Boolean Expressions
- An expression like `x < y` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- Indentation determines which statements execute when a condition is met.

### Conditional Statements
- `if` – Executes a block of code if a condition is true.  
- `elif` – Short for *else if*; tests another condition if the previous one is false.  
- `else` – Executes a block of code when none of the preceding conditions are true.

### Logical Operators
- `or` – Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.  
- `and` – Returns `True` only if both conditions are true.  
- Useful for creating upper and lower bounds within conditions.

### Arithmetic and Modulus
- `%` (modulus) – Returns the remainder of a division operation.

### Boolean Values
- The `bool` data type represents only two values: `True` or `False`.

## Notes
- Fewer conditional blocks improve both efficiency and readability.
- Clear indentation and logical structure are essential for maintainable code.
