## Lecture 5 â€“ Unit Tests

### Key Concepts
- `__name__` is a special variable in Python that is set to a specific value depending on how the script is executed. Code execution typically starts from where `__name__` is evaluated.  
- `assert` is used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is true, nothing happens; if it is false, an error is raised.  

### Testing Tools
- **pytest** is a third-party library that automates the testing of code, provided that the programmer has written the tests.  
- To install pytest, use `pip install pytest`.  

### Python Organization
- A **package** is a collection of multiple Python modules organized inside a folder, allowing for structured code organization and reuse.
