## Lecture 3 â€“ Exceptions

### Error Types
- **Exceptions** refer to problems that occur within code when something goes wrong.  
- **SyntaxError** occurs when there is a mistake in the Python syntax. These errors are caused by the programmer and must be corrected manually.  
- **Runtime errors** happen while the code is executing. You need to write code to detect and handle these errors.

### Handling Exceptions
- `try` and `except` are used to check for exceptional conditions and handle errors gracefully. (See examples in `number.py`)  
- `NameError` occurs when a variable is used before it is defined.  
- `else` can be used in a `try` block to execute code if no exception occurs. (Examples in `number.py`)  

### Loop and Function Control
- `return` sends a value back from a function, and can also exit a loop.  
- `break` exits a loop immediately.  
- `pass` can be used to ignore a command or leave a code block empty.
