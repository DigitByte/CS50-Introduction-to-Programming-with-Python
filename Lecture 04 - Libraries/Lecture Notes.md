## Lecture 3 â€“ Libraries

### Libraries and Modules
- **Libraries** are collections of code written by others that you can use in your own programs.  
- A **module** is a library that contains one or more functions, encouraging code reuse.  
- Python includes many built-in libraries, such as `random`.

### Importing and Using Modules
- `import` is used to include a module in your program.  
- `random.choice(seq)` returns a random element from a sequence or sequence-like object.  
- `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer between `a` and `b`, inclusive.  
- `random.shuffle(x)` randomizes the order of elements in a list.  

### Other Modules
- Python includes a **statistics** module for basic statistical operations.  
- The `sys` module provides functions related to the Python runtime environment.  

### Additional Concepts
- **Slicing a list** means taking a subset of the list.  
- A **package** is a module implemented within a folder, providing access to more functionality.  
- `pip` is a program used to install packages onto your system.  
- **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language-agnostic format used to exchange data, commonly used in APIs and large databases.
