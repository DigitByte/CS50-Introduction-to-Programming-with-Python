## Lecture 2 – Loops

### Loop Types
- `while` – Repeats a block of code as long as a specified Boolean condition remains `True`.  
- `for` – Iterates over a sequence (e.g., range, list, string).

### Lists
- **List (`list`)** – A data type that can store multiple values in a single variable.  
- `range(n)` – Produces a sequence of `n` numbers starting from 0.  
- Indexing with `[]` allows access to specific elements in a list.  
- `len()` – Returns the number of items in a list (and works on other iterable objects).

### Loop Control
- `while True:` – Runs an infinite loop until explicitly broken.  
- `break` – Terminates the current loop.  
- `return` – Exits a function and returns a value.

### Dictionaries
- **Dictionary (`dict`)** – Stores key-value pairs inside `{}`.  
- Keys can be strings or other immutable types, allowing descriptive indexing.  
- Acts as a two-dimensional mapping between data.

### Special Values
- `None` – Represents the absence of a value or a null reference.

## Notes
- Keep loops efficient to avoid unnecessary iterations.  
- Use `break` carefully to maintain readability and avoid unexpected behavior.  
- Dictionaries are useful for mapping relationships between data elements.
